# REAL TIME AIR-QUALITY MONITORING
- This project focuses on analyzing air quality data using a dataset containing air pollution metrics such as particular matter(PM),nitrogen dioxide(NO2),sufur dioxide(SO2),and other environmental factors.

## Installation
- pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

## Features:
- Bivariate Analysis: Examines realtionships between different pollutants and environmental factors.
- Data Modeling: Implements various regression techniques to predict air quality.
- Performance Evaluation: Compares model accuracy using different metrics.

## Models Used:
- Linear Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbours(KNN)
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor
